Image classification:
	data arranged into train and validation
	
	Model is built and compiled
	Trained on the data
	Model is saved to disk
	
	class loads the model
	
	loads image from path 
	formats the image data to fit model input layer
	uses the model to predict the class it belongs to
	returns the name of the class with the highest score

	When the user asks the chatbot to classify an image
	a file dialoge box opens to let the user to pick the image
	the class name is then used to retrieve the description of that 
	creature from the withcer 3 wiki

Gan 

	Descriminator is built
	Genorator is built

	Models combined to create gan
	Descriminator weights set not trainable 

	real samples loaded
	Real samples with noise loaded

	Loops until reaches specified number of epochs
	retrieves random batch of real samples
	and noisy samples	

	trains descriminator on real and noisy samples
	sets noisy samples label to 0.5

	Discriminator trained on fake samples.
	Generator generates fake samples used for training.

	Generator is trained to better fool the descriminator.

	Performance is summerised every 10 epochs
	Generated images written to disk so performance can be reviewed
